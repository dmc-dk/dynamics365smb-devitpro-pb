# The Business Central Administration Center API

The [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] API enables administrators to programmatically do administrative tasks for a [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] tenant. With the API, administrators can, for example:

- Query and work with production and sandbox environments for the tenant.
- Set up administrative notifications.
- View telemetry for events on the tenant.

For more information about administrative capabilities, see [The Business Central Administration Center](tenant-admin-center.md). This article describes the API contracts for these administrative capabilities.

## Location
The [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] API is located at the following URL: https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com.

## Setting up Azure Active Directory (AAD) based authentication
Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to register your client application as an app and enable it to call the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] API.

1. Follow the instructions in the [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications) article. The next steps elaborate on some of the specific settings you must enable.
2. Give the application a **Name**, such as **Business Central Web Service Client**.
3. For **Application type**, choose either **Native** or **Web app/API** depending on your scenario. The code examples below assume **Native**.
4. Choose a **Redirect URI**. If it's a **Native** app, you can choose for example: **BusinessCentralWebServiceClient://auth**. If it's a **Web app/API** app, set the value to the actual URL of the web application.
5. During the registration of the app, make sure to go to **Settings**, and then under **API ACCESS**, choose **Required permissions**. Choose **Add**, and then under **Add API Access**, choose **Select an API** and search for the **Dynamics 365** option. Choose **Dynamics 365**, select **Delegated permissions**, and then choose the **Done** button.  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > If **Dynamics 365** doesn't show up in search, it's because the tenant doesn't have any knowledge of Dynamics 365. To make it visible, an easy way is to register for a [free trial](https://signup.microsoft.com/signup?sku=6a4a1628-9b9a-424d-bed5-4118f0ede3fd&ru=https%3A%2F%2Fbusinesscentral.dynamics.com%2FSandbox%2F%3FredirectedFromSignup%3D1) for Dynamics 365 Business Central with a user from the directory.
6. Make a note of both the **Application ID** and the **Redirect URI**. They'll be needed later.


## Getting an access token
HTTP requests sent to the [!INCLUDE[prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)] API must include the Authorization HTTP header, and the value must be an access token.

The following examples show how to obtain such a token using PowerShell. Using C# is straightforward.

PowerShell example without prompt:
 ```powershell
    $cred = [Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.UserPasswordCredential]::new($UserName, $Password)
    $ctx = [Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.AuthenticationContext]::new("https://login.windows.net/$TenantName")
    $token = [Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.AuthenticationContextIntegratedAuthExtensions]::AcquireTokenAsync($ctx, "https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com", <Application ID>, $cred).GetAwaiter().GetResult().AccessToken
 ```
 
 PowerShell example with prompt:

 ```powershell
    $ctx = [Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.AuthenticationContext]::new("https://login.windows.net/$tenantName")
    $redirectUri = New-Object -TypeName System.Uri -ArgumentList <Redirect URL>
    $platformParameters = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.PlatformParameters -ArgumentList ([Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.PromptBehavior]::Always)
    $token = $ctx.AcquireTokenAsync("https://api.businesscentral.dynamics.com", <Application ID>, $redirectUri, $platformParameters).GetAwaiter().GetResult().AccessToken
 ```

## Error Format

If an error occurs during the execution of an API method, it will respond back with an error object. While the specifics of any error will vary from endpoint to endpoint and by the error, the error object returned should adhere to the following structure. When an error occurs that doesn't fit this structure, it typically indicates that an error occurred in sending the request or during authentication of the request. For example, it could be that the API hasn't yet received the request. 

**Error Response Object:**  
```
{
"code": string, // A stable error code describing the type an nature of the error. Ex: EnvironmentNotFound
"message": string, // A message with a readable description of the error and cause. Intended to assist with debugging or troubleshooting the API, it's not intended to be displayed.
("target": string), // Optional - Provides information about what part of a request caused the error. Ex: The name of a property on the request body.
("extensionData": {...}), // Optional - A key/value dictionary object containing additional information about the error.
("clientError": [ // Optional - A nested list of error objects containing more details about the error encountered. For instance, this may be used if multiple errors are encountered to list them all out.
  {
    "code": string,
    "message": string,
    "target": string,
    "extensionData": {...},
    "clientError": [...]
  })
]
}
```

**General unhandled errors**

All unknown and unhandled errors that aren't covered by the lists above will use the error code: **Unknown** 


## Environments

Environments are the instances of the application that have been set up for the tenant. An instance can be of either a production type or a sandbox type. Currently, it's only possible to create three production environments and three sandbox environments per tenant. The environment APIs can be used to:

- Get information about the environments currently set up for the tenant
- Create a new environment using sample data or as a sandbox copy of the production environment
- Delete an environment.

> [!NOTE]  
> Special care should be taken when deleting a production environment as the data will not be recoverable

`environmentName` - Name of the environment to delete.


> [!NOTE]  
> The Create, Copy, and Delete operations are asynchronous. The response objects are returned before the underlying operation has completed.
> The final results of the operation are reflected in the 'status' field of the environment that the operations affect.
> In practice this means that polling of the 'Get Environments' endpoints must be done to determine if the given operation was successful.

#### Expected Error Codes

`invalidStatusCannotDeleteTenant` - can't delete the environment in its current state

`tenantDeletionInProgress` - environment is already in the process of being deleted

## Application Access Management
It's possible for a **Delegated Tenant Admin** to manage access to application families available in the service. The application family is [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../developer/includes/prodshort.md)] or other independent software vendor (ISV) applications that may be provisioned through the service. 

You can get the list of applications that are available to the tenant. From this list you can determine, by setting the access property, for which applications an environment may be provisioned on the tenant.

### Get List Of Manageable Applications
Returns a list of manageable applications by family and country code.

```
GET /admin/v2.1/manageableapplications
```

#### Response
Returns a wrapped array of applications.

```
{
  "value": [
    {
      "applicationFamily":  string, // The name of the family for a given Business Central offered application. (Typically this will just be "BusinessCentral") 
      "access":  boolean, // Indicates if the tenant has access to the application family/country code combination
      "countryCode": string, // The country code of the application.
    }
  ]
}
```

### Control the access to Applications
Pass the application family name in the URL and a boolean in the body. 
- True - enables the access.
- False - disables the access.

```
PUT /admin/v2.1/manageableapplications/{applicationFamily}/countries/{countryCode}
```

#### Route Parameters

`applicationFamily` - The name of the family for a given Business Central offered application. (Typically this value will just be "BusinessCentral")

`countryCode` - Country code for the targeted application.

#### Body

{
  <boolean> // Desired access state
}
```

#### Expected Error Codes
